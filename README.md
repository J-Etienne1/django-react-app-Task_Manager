# React-Django-Task_Manager
A Task Manager application created in React as the  client-side and Django Rest Framework as the server-side

So React serves as the front-end , handling UI through the requests to Django's backend.

The prerequistes for this project are 2 essential elements:

1- Python 3 [ prefereably 3.5 and above] 

2- Node.js - you can install node from nodejs.com and download it very easily, and you can check it if it was properly installed or not : node --version

And we are going to start by our favorite side which is the backend , I'm saying our favorite side because this channel focuses on server-side programming and mainly Python.
